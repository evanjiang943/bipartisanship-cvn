The U.S. House of Representatives is the primary legislative body in American democracy. Over recent decades, it has become increasingly partisan, meaning that members of opposing political parties rarely collaborate or vote together. This trend contributes to legislative gridlock, where important bills fail to pass due to ideological divides. Bipartisanship is crucial for addressing national challenges effectively. However, identifying bipartisan representatives is not straightforward, as traditional methods often oversimplify the complex dynamics of voting behavior. Our primary question is: How can statistical network modeling techniques be used to identify bipartisan representatives in the U.S. House of Representatives? By answering this, we aim to provide a systematic and replicable framework for analyzing bipartisanship.
