The U.S. House of Representatives is the primary legislative body in American democracy. Over recent decades, it has become increasingly partisan, meaning that members of opposing political parties rarely collaborate or vote together. This trend contributes to legislative gridlock, where important bills fail to pass due to ideological divides. Bipartisanship—where members from both parties work together—is crucial for addressing national challenges effectively. However, identi- fying bipartisan representatives is not straightforward, as traditional methods often oversimplify the complex dynamics of voting behavior.
The motivation for this work lies in the need for tools to ”cut through the noise” of congressional voting data. Instead of relying on broad perceptions or simplified metrics, we aim to use rigorous statistical methods to identify representatives who consistently demonstrate bipartisanship. This analysis has practical implications, such as identifying legislators who might mediate between divided factions or highlighting patterns of collaboration that could inform future policymaking.
Our primary question is: How can statistical network modeling techniques be used to identify bi- partisan representatives in the U.S. House of Representatives? By answering this, we aim to provide a systematic and replicable framework for analyzing bipartisanship.
